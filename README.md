# BigTaskEnergy

This project's purpose is a companion to the YouTube tutorial that demonstrates implementation
techniques involving the following:

* App Architecture
* Dependency injection using Hilt
* Data persistence using Room
* Reactive UIs using Flow and coroutines for asynchronous operations
* Multiple product flavours, `debug` and `release`
* Single activity architecture using compose navigation

## Yet another "todo" app... whyyyy???
This application is meant to be simple enough to easily understand, but complex enough to
demonstrate more advanced implementations of various concepts.
